# adv-calculus-exhibition-optimization-project

This project was created for my Advanced Calculus exhibition project.

It uses color recognition to simulate real-world scenarios involving cost, material, and area optimization. The project features a full user interface, including an optimization summary, detailed material and cost breakdowns, a live camera feed with detection, a grid-based area visualization, and more.
